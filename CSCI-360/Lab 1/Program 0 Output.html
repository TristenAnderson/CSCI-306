<p>Here is some of the output from the Lab Training exercise,
   also known as Assignment 0. 

</p><pre>0BEGIN XSNAP - CALL     1 AT E000000A USER REGISTERS                                                                                 
0 REGS 0-7      F4F4F4F4    0B0B0B0C    F4F4F4F4    F4F4F4F4    F4F4F4F4    F4F4F4F4    F4F4F4F4    F4F4F4F4                         
  REGS 8-15     F4F4F4F4    F4F4F4F4    F4F4F4F4    F4F4F4F4    F4F4F4F4    00000010    FFFE7960    00000000</pre>

<p>The two lines labeled as "REGS" list the values of the 16 registers, 0 through 7 on
   the first line and 8 through 15 on the second line.  The code in the sample
   program sets register 1 to the value X'0B0B0B0C'.  Most of the others have a
   default value of F4F4F4F4.  Sooner or later we will learn more about the values in
   the last three registers.
