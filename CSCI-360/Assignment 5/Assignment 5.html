<h2><b>
<p>Assignment 5
</p></b><p><b>100 points
</b></p></h2>
</center>

<p><b>Overview</b>

</p><p>In this assignment, you will rewrite the program you wrote in
   Assignment 4 using external subroutines instead of internal subroutines.
   You will need to use standard entry linkage and exit linkage in the
   main routine and in each subroutine.

</p><p>There are a few minor changes and one additional subroutine.

</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Input</b>

</p><p>The input to the program will be a file with an unknown number of
   records.

</p><p>The data starts with a number of lines very much like those in
   the data for Assignment 4, followed by a line containing the 
   integer -44444444.  This number serves as a delimiter and is not
   part of the data.  After that are several lines each containing 
   one small nonzero integer.

</p><p>Use the following JCL statement to specify the input file:

</p><pre>     //FT05F001  DD  DSN=KC02314.SPRING20.CSCI360.HW5DATA,DISP=SHR</pre>

<p></p><hr>

<p><b>What needs to be done</b>

</p><ul>
 <li>Call the BUILD subroutine to read lines in the file until it
     find the delimiter line.  Each line contains zero or more 
     integers.  Put the integers in the table.  Do not put the
     delimiter value -44444444 in the table.  Return to the
     main program.
     <p>
 </p></li><li>After that, in the main routine, print a heading saying something 
     like "Table Contents".
     <p>
 </p></li><li>Now call subroutine PRINT to print the contents of the table with 
     6 numbers on each line.
     <p>
 </p></li><li>Next, call the HOWMANY subroutine which will read the rest of the file.
  </li></ul>


<p></p><hr>

<p><b>External Subroutines</b>

</p><p>You will need several external subroutines:

</p><ul list-style-type="DISC">
 <li>BUILD is a subroutine that will read the input file and build
     the table.  It will store the address of the last entry in
     a fullword passed in as its second parameter.
     <p>The arguments for BUILD are:
        </p><ul list-style-type="SQUARE">
         <li>the address of the input buffer
         </li><li>the address of the table
         </li><li>the address of a fullword containing the address of the
             first available entry
        </li></ul>
     <p>
 </p></li><li>PRINT is a subroutine that will print the numbers in the table 
     with 6 values per line, starting on a new page and double-spaced.
     <p>The arguments for PRINT are:
        </p><ul list-style-type="SQUARE">
         <li>the address of the table
         </li><li>the address of a fullword containing the address of the
             next available entry
        </li></ul>
     <p>
 </p></li><li>HOWMANY is a subroutine that will count numbers in the table that
     are multiples of the last few numbers in the file.
     <p>The arguments for TALLY are:
        </p><ul list-style-type="SQUARE">
         <li>the address of the input buffer
         </li><li>the address of the table
         </li><li>the address of a fullword containing the address of the
             first available entry
        </li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>There are several requirements for using an external subroutine:

</p><ul>
 <li>Each external subroutine is actually a separate program.  You
     need a <u>CSECT</u> with the name of the subroutine, as in:

<pre>     BUILD    CSECT</pre>
     <p>
 </p></li><li>You need to create a <u>parameter list</u> for the subroutine (a set
     of consecutive fullwords, each containing the address of a
     parameter).  We did this with internal subroutines.
     <p>
 </p></li><li>You need to <u>call</u> the subroutine, as in:

<pre>     LA      1,BPARMS         Parmlist for BUILD
     L       15,=V(BUILD)     Get the address of BUILD  
     BALR    14,15            Branch to BUILD</pre>

     <p>Here the BALR instruction will set register 14 = the address
        of the next instruction after the BALR.
     </p><p>
 </p></li><li>In the subroutine, you need a <u>register save area</u> and
     <u>standard entry linkage</u>.  (You should probably go read
        about standard entry linkage.)
     <p>
 </p></li><li>At the end of the subroutine, you need <u>standard exit linkage</u>.
     (You should probably go read about standard exit linkage.)
</li></ul>     

<p></p><hr>

<p><b>What does the HOWMANY subroutine do?</b>

</p><p>The HOWMANY subroutine will read each line in the file after the 
   delimiter.  For each line, it should do the following:
   </p><ul list-style-type="SQUARE">
    <li>extract the integer M on the line using XDECI
    </li><li>in a loop, go through the table and count the multiples of M
    </li><li>print a line stating the number of multiples of M in the table
   </li></ul>

<p></p><hr>

<p><b>Other Requirements</b>

</p><ul>
 <li>The JCL for this assignment is the same as the JCL for
     Assignment 4 except the line above to specify the input file.
     <p>
 </p></li><li>You may assume that the table needs to hold no more than
     75 values.  You do not need to count the numbers.  Each entry
     is one fullword.  Initialize the table to the value -16 (as
     in 75F'-16').
     <p>
 </p></li><li>In PRINT, double-space between lines of numbers.
     <p>    
 </p></li><li>In HOWMANY, triple-space the lines of output.
     <p>
 </p></li><li>You may use register equates if you want, but it is not required.
     <p>
 </p></li><li>You may use extended mnemonics such as BH, BL, BNE, etc. for branch
     instructions.
     <p>
 </p></li><li>Document your program as usual and submit it through Blackboard
     as usual.
</li></ul>
