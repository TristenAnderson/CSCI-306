<p>Assignment 6
</p></b><p><b>100 points
</b></p></h2></center>

<p><b>Overview</b>

</p><p>A beginning entrepreneur named Susan Glimpshire has been trying 
   a number of small business ventures.  While she is rather creative, 
   she is not always successful.  She made money on some of them and on 
   others she lost money (cats don't like to wear sweaters, for instance).

</p><p>In this assignment, we have data about Susan's ventures.  We will store the
   data in a table, print the table and then calculate and print some
   statistics about Susan's progress.

</p><p>In particular, this program will make use of external subroutines, 
   character data and packed decimal numbers.

</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Input</b>

</p><p>The input to the program will be a file with an unknown number of records.  

</p><p>Each record represents a single business venture and has the following format:

</p><pre>     columns         description
     -------         -----------
      1 - 30         Description (characters)
     31 - 32         blanks             
     33 - 37         Profit or Loss (5 digits zoned decimal)
     38 - 80         not used (blanks)
</pre>

<p>A positive value indicates that Susan made a profit, and a negative
   value indicates that Susan lost money.

</p><p>Use the following JCL statement to specify the input file:

</p><pre>//FT05F001  DD  DSN=KC02314.SPRING20.CSCI360.HW6DATA,DISP=SHR</pre>

<p></p><hr>

<p><b>Processing Requirements</b>

</p><p>The main program will carry out the following steps:

</p><ul list-style-type="DISC">
 <li>Call subroutine BUILD to read the first group of records and store 
     the data in a table.  
     <p>
 </p></li><li>Call subroutine PRINT to print the contents of the table, using 
     column headings.  
     <p>
 </p></li><li>Call subroutine STATS to calculate and print a number of statistics (see below).
</li></ul> 

<p>For each subroutine, you can use the same parameter list:
     </p><ul list-style-type="CIRCLE">
      <li>the address of the table
      </li><li>the address of a fullword containing the address of the first
          unused entry
     </li></ul>      

<p></p><hr>

<p><b>What statistics do we need?</b>

</p><p>The STATs subroutine should calculate and print:
   </p><ul>
    <li>How many business ventures were there?
    </li><li>How many of them made money (positive value)?
    </li><li>How many of them lost money (negative value)?
    </li><li>Which venture had the largest profit?
    </li><li>Which venture had the greatest loss?
    </li><li>What was the grand total for all ventures together?
    </li><li>What was the average result per venture? (rounded to the nearest penny)
   </li></ul>
   
<p></p><hr>

<p><b>Other Notes</b>

</p><ol>
 <li>You may assume that the table needs to hold no more than 25
     values.
     <p>
 </p></li><li>Use this DSECT to describe a table entry:
<pre>     $ENTRY   DSECT
     $DESCR   DS    30C
     $VALUE   DS    PL3</pre>
     <p>
     </p><p>Put the DSECT at the top before MAIN.
     </p><p> 
 </p></li><li>Write this program incrementally, one subroutine at a time.  Start 
     with BUILD.  You may want to XDUMP the table to see whether BUILD is
     correct.  After that, write and test PRINT.  Once you have PRINT
     working, you can go on to STATS.
     <p>
 </p></li><li>The JCL for this assignment is the same as the JCL used in
     Assignments 4 and 5 except for the line given above to provide
     the data.
     <p>
 </p></li><li>All of these subroutines are external subroutines.  You will
     need standard entry and exit linkage in the main routine and in
     each subroutine.
     <p>
 </p></li><li>You may not use XDECI or XDECO anywhere in this assignment.
     The numbers should all be stored in packed decimal format.
     You will need to decide on the lengths to use.
     <p>
 </p></li><li>When you print amounts of money, print a leading dollar sign,
     a decimal point and two digits to the right of the decimal
     point.  If an amount of money is negative, print <u>CR</u>
     to the right of the value.
     <p>
 </p></li></ol>

<p></p><hr>

<p><b>Output</b>

</p><p>Each page should have a page heading, centered.  The pages should be
   numbered.

</p><p>Column headings should be double-spaced from the page header.

</p><p>PRINT should have a page heading saying something like "Susan's 
   Business Ventures".  

</p><p>In the output from PRINT, the lines of customer information should be 
   double spaced.  The output from PRINT should all fit on one page.

</p><p>In the output from PRINT, the summary lines should be triple-spaced from 
   the last customer record.  Double-space between summary lines.

</p><p>STATS should start its output on a new page.  There should be a page
   heading saying something like "Summary of Susan's Business Ventures".

</p><p>In the output from STATS, the lines should be triple-spaced.

</p><p>The output from STATS should all fit on one page.
