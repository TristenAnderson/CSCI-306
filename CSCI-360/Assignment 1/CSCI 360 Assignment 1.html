<p>CSCI 360
</p><p>Assignment 1
</p></b><p><b>50 points
</b></p></h2></center>

<p>This assignment is in three parts:

</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Part A</b>

</p><p>Write a program that does the following:

</p><ul type="DISC">
 <li>Declare a fullword FIRST with the value 219.
 </li><li>Declare a fullword SECOND with the value 83.
 </li><li>Add SECOND to FIRST.  To do this, simply load these numbers
     into registers and use an AR.
 </li><li>Subtract SECOND from FIRST.  To do this, load the two numbers into 
     registers (a different pair of registers) and use an SR.
 </li><li>Now use an XDUMP to dump out the registers and look at the
     register values to see your results.
</li></ul>

<p></p><hr>

<p><b>Part B</b>

</p><p>Modify the program from Part A as follows:

</p><ul>
 <li>Declare two consecutive fullwords of storage called SUM and DIFF.
 </li><li>Store (ST) the sum (FIRST plus SECOND) into SUM.
 </li><li>Store (ST) the difference (FIRST minus SECOND) into DIFF.
 </li><li>XDUMP that area of storage (containing SUM and DIFF) using XDUMP.  
     You can use XDUMP to print the values in storage by using the label 
     followed by the length of the field like this:  
<pre>     XDUMP SUM,8</pre>
 <p>or maybe as two lines:
</p><pre>     XDUMP SUM,4 
     XDUMP DIFF,4</pre>
 </li><li>Look at the XDUMP output and verify your arithmetic is correct.
</li></ul>

<p></p><hr>

<p><b>Part C</b>

</p><p>Now rewrite your program using explicit addressing.  This
   means on the L and ST, take out your labels and fill in the
   addresses of the various fullwords.  You can get these addresses
   from the program listing of part B (in a column at the left).

</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Other Notes</b>

</p><p>Hint:  Start with the JCL and the trivial little program we had in 
   the lab training exercise.  Take out the two SR lines and put in 
   what you need.

</p><p>Be sure your name and the assignment number (including Part A, B or C)
   is included in the documentation for each file.

</p><p>Turn in all three programs (from Parts A, B and C) and the output file
   from Part C.
