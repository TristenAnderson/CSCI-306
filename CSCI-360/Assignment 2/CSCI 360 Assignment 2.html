<h2><b>
<p>Assignment 2
</p></b><p><b>80 points
</b></p></h2>
</center>

<p>For this assignment you will write a program that reads in an unknown
   number of lines, each containing 3-digit numbers, 4 per line.  For each 
   line read, print out the numbers W, X, Y and Z, calculate the value
   of Z - Y - X + W and print the result, single-spaced.

</p><p>Each line has the following format:
</p><pre>     columns 1--3   blank
     columns 4--6   first number W
     columns 7--9   blank
     columns 10-12  second number X
     columns 13-15  blank
     columns 16-18  third number Y
     columns 19-21  blank
     columns 22-24  fourth number Z
     columns 25-80  blank</pre>

<p>When all processing is done, skip a line and then print the sum of the 
   result values from all of the lines and the number of lines read.

</p><p>Write your program incrementally!  That means that you should begin by just
   reading one record and print out those numbers.  When that works,
   put in a loop. If you get one part working before moving on to
   the next, your debugging will be much easier and less time-consuming.

</p><p>Use a top driven loop:

</p><pre>Initialize the counter and the total
     Top of the loop
      Read a record
      If end-of-file, branch to the end of the loop
      Deal with the record just read using XDECI, arithmetic, XDECO and XPRNT
      Add 1 to the counter
      Add the result (Z - Y - X + W) of the numbers read to the total
      Branch to the top of the loop
     End of the loop
     Use XDECO and XPRNT to print the summary lines</pre>

<p>You will need to put labels on two lines, one for the top of the
   loop and one for the bottom of the loop.  You can actually put a
   label on any line of code, but many people put them on lines that
   don't do anything else, like this:

</p><pre>     MYLABEL  DS    0H</pre>

<p>Here <u>DS    0H</u> takes up no space.  (It declares 0 halfwords on
   a halfword boundary, and as each instruction is an even number of
   bytes, the location will already be on a halfword boundary.)

<p><b>JCL for this assignment</b>

</p><p>Use the following JCL:

</p><pre>//KCnumberA JOB ,'Your Name',MSGCLASS=H
//STEP1    EXEC  PGM=ASSIST
//STEPLIB    DD  DSN=KC02293.ASSIST.LOADLIB,DISP=SHR

(Your program goes here.)

//</pre>

<p>As before, you will need to replace "Your Name" with your own
   name, and you will need to replace "KCnumber" with your own
   logon ID.

</p><p>Your actual code should be after the comment box and before the
   /* line.

</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Data</b>

</p><p>As indicated above, the data is listed in the source code file
   between the <u>FT05FT001</u> line and the following <u>/*</u> line.

</p><p>This is known as <u>instream</u> data.  It is also possible to
   read from a specific disk file by name, and we will do so later.

</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Other requirements</b>

</p><p>In the JCL, at the very beginning of the program is a <u>comment
   box</u>.  Notice the place that says "Register Usage".  Make a
   list here of registers you used and how you made use of each one.
   For instance, you will be using register 15 as your base register,
   and register 1 is used by XDECI.  Thus you might have:

</p><pre>*
*  Register usage:
*    1        Used by XDECI
*   15        Base register
*</pre>

<p>and probably several more such lines.  It can be difficult in
   assembly language to read the code without a guide to how
   the various register are being used.

</p><p>The comment box should also list your name and the number of
   the assignment (Assignment 2).

</p><p>To use XREAD, you will need to have an 80-byte field to contain
   each line you read.

</p><p>To produce the output, you will need to define a couple of output lines
   containing DC and DS statements (with labels on the DS statements).

</p><p>Your program should include <u>line documentation</u>.  At the
   end of each line (certainly for most lines) skip one or more
   spaces and insert a few words describing what that instruction
   does.  Try to line these up so they start in the same column.
   For instance:
</p><pre>         SR    8,8                     Initialize counter.
         SR    9,9                     Initialize total.</pre>

<p>Name your program file something like "ASSIGN2" or "ASSIGN2".

</p><p>Submit your program file and output file through Blackboard.
